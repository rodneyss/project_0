# Project 1 - tick tack toe

---

Ryu and Chun-li wish to play tick tack toe. Assist them!
Tick tack toe with the addition of a dumb AI.

* Player 1 is always first 
* Player 1 will always be Ryu on the left assigned "X" as his symbol.
* Click on a middle square to choose it
* AI is on by default and assigned to Chun-li. 
* The AI can be turned on and off during the game. 


**_Issues:_**

Wanted a dynamic middle table but had display issues with border, so hardcoded them in html.

Performance issue using jQuery...i think... so ended up using plain old javascript for swapping out gifs, and some animations.

**_TODO:_**

* Cleaner code
* Smarter AI :O
